# Enzyme Mechasnism Simulator

## Description

This module is designed to help the teaching and learning of enzyme kinetics and Michaelis-Menten kinetics through running a few simulations. The module is made of four exercises that explore the basic enzyme reaction (E + S ⇌ ES → E + P): 

1. Determine enzyme concentration to use
2. Run up to five simulations of enzyme kinetics experiements and plot the change in [P] as a function of time
3. Do the same thing as Exercise 2 but plot the initial rate of the raction as a function of [S]
4. Predict Km and Vmax based on the plot data you have got and check the answer

## How to run

Run the following command in the R console:

```R
shiny::runGitHub("Enzyme-Mechasnism-Simulation","MasayukiNagai")
```
